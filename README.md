# Semisupervised-Anomaly-Detection-Pytorch
A general framework for semi-supervised anomaly detection models written in PyTorch.   
Some functions are referenced from https://github.com/lukasruff/Deep-SAD-PyTorch, and have been noted in the function strings.  
Reading recommendations: dataset --> network --> model --> main.   
A comprehensive readme file will get uploaded soon.
